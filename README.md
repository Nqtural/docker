A repository for three things. Two docker-compose.yml files, one for Drupal and one for Wordpress, as well as a guide to how to use them. 

### Guide to Docker

### Drupal
A docker-compose.yml-file to start a container with Drupal 8 and postgresql. In version 1.0 it is the same as is found on docker.com.

### Wordpress
